### 🏙️ Mission Statement
At Yarniverse, our mission is to create a space where those who partake in fiber arts such as crochet can connect and manage their projects all in one place! 🧶
___

### 🚀 Problem Statement

Many fiber artists lack a platform completely dedicated to their craft. At Yarniverse, crochet enthusiasts will be able to have a streamlined application that would provide a way to connect with fellow crocheters, showcase their own projects and be a resource for patterns and materials. In using this application, users will be able to access a community of their peers dedicated to the craft they love most.

### 📝 Features & User Stories
* Describes all the features and their purpose.
* For each feature, outline the user flow.
* Identify features required for a MVP


Example: 

* **User Profile Page (MVP)**: Users can sign into the application to see their profile page. The profile page will display all of their projects, their profile picture and bio, and settings for updating their profile.
* **Project Management Page (MVP)**: Users can either create a new project to track the project they are working on or view their old projects. With creating a new project, a user can give it a title and description, as well as including what hook they are using and the type of project they are working on. 
* **Newsfeed (MVP)**: Users can create their own posts to update others on their projects as well as view the content of other users that they choose to follow. A user can like and comment on posts as well. 
* **Pattern Uploading (Stretch)**: Users can create a new pattern for others to follow. They can give the pattern a title and description and upload it to the website.
